          <strong>Microscope Photography:</strong> these photos are just a bunch
          of cool things I saw down a microscope! These were mostly taken with
          an iPhone 12 mini or iPhone SE down a microscope lens. Note: none of
          these images were captured digitally directly, and these arenâ€™t
          representative of my recent research! (Many confocal images of
          Synechocystis sp. , a cyanobacterium).
