        <h1>Photography</h1>I have been an enthusiastic amateur photographer for
        many years, with experience photographing cityscapes, landscapes,
        wildlife, and macro photography (as well as occasional portrait photos
        for friends and family members). I currently use a Sony DLSR camera, and
        my portfolio can be found{" "}

          <strong>Travel Photography:</strong> these photos. Mostly taken with a
          Sony DSLR camera.{" "}

          <strong>Microscope Photography:</strong> these photos are just a bunch
          of cool things I saw down a microscope! These were mostly taken with
          an iPhone 12 mini or iPhone SE down a microscope lens. Note: none of
          these images were captured digitally directly, and these arenâ€™t
          representative of my recent research! (Many confocal images of
          Synechocystis sp. , a cyanobacterium).
